# Supalosa's Chrono Divide Bot

[中文版文档](README-CN.md)

[Chrono Divide](https://chronodivide.com/) is a ground-up rebuild of Red Alert 2 in the browser. It is feature-complete and allows for online skirmish play against other players.
It also provides [an API to build bots](https://discord.com/channels/771701199812558848/842700851520339988), as there is no built-in AI yet.

This repository is one such implementation of a bot. The original template for the bot is available at [game-api-playground](https://github.com/chronodivide/game-api-playground/blob/master/README.md).

## Development State and Future plans

The developer of Chrono Divide has integrated the bot into the game. Therefore, its intention is to be a stable, performant implementation for newer players to play against, rather than a complex and competitive opponent.

See `TODO.md` for a granular list of structural changes and feature improvements that are planned for the bot.

Feel free to contribute to the repository, or even fork the repo and build your own version.

## Repository structure

* `packages/chronodivide-bot`: The actual bot logic. This is also published to `@supalosa/chronodivide-bot` and used by the live Chrono Divide game.
* `packages/chronodivide-bot-driver`: A project that runs the bot and will soon provide debug visualisation capability (since the bot will normally run in headless mode).

## Quick start instructions

Node 20 is required by the Chrono Divide API. However, publishing is done on Node 24 or above.

From the **root** directory:
```sh
npm install
npm run watch # will monitor and recompile upon any changes to the bot or driver
```

Then, in another terminal, from the **`packages/chronodivide-bot-driver`** directory:
```
# for example
export GAMEPATH="C:\Origin\Command and Conquer Red Alert II"

npx cross-env MIX_DIR="${GAMEPATH}" npm start
```

This will create a replay (`.rpl`) file that can be [imported into the live game](https://game.chronodivide.com/).

You can modify `index.ts` to configure the match. You will most likely want to look at the line with `const mapName = "..."` to change the map, or the `const offlineSettingsXXX` to change the bot countries.


## Playing against the bot

Currently, playing against this bot **is only possible for developers**, because it requires you to run this repository from source. Follow these steps to set up online play.

### Initial set up steps (one time only)

1. Create a Chronodivide account for your bot using the official client at [https://game.chronodivide.com].
2. If you don't already have one, create a Chronodivide account for yourself using the same link,
3. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`. The `.env` file is not checked into the repo.
4. Set the value of `ONLINE_BOT_NAME` to the username of the bot from step 1.
5. Set the value of `ONLINE_BOT_PASSWORD` to the password from step 1.
6. Set the value of `PLAYER_NAME` to the human's account name.
7. (Optional) Change `SERVER_URL` if you want to connect to another server. The Chronodivide accounts from step 1 and 2 need to be present on that server.

### Running the bot and connecting to the game

Start the bot with `ONLINE_MATCH=1`. For example:

```sh
ONLINE_MATCH=1 npx cross-env MIX_DIR="${GAMEPATH}" npm --node-options="${NODE_OPTIONS} --inspect" start
```

The bot will connect to the server and should return output like this:

```
You may use the following link(s) to join, after the game is created:

https://game.chronodivide.com/#/game/12345/supalosa


Press ENTER to create the game now...
```

Navigate to the link, **log in using the human credentials first**, then hit ENTER in the terminal so the bot can create the game.
Do not hit ENTER too early, as there is a very narrow window for the human to connect to the match.

## Debugging

To generate a replay with debugging enabled:

```sh
npx cross-env MIX_DIR="C:\path_to_ra2_install_dir" npm --node-options="${NODE_OPTIONS} --inspect" start
```

To log all actions generated by the bots:

```sh
DEBUG_LOGGING="action" npx cross-env MIX_DIR="${GAMEPATH}" npm --node-options="${NODE_OPTIONS} --inspect" start
```

We also take advantage of the in-game bot debug functionality provided by CD. These are basically bot-only actions that are saved in the replay, but you must enable the visualisations in the CD client before watching the replay, by typing the following into the dev console:.

```
r.debug_text = true;
```

This will debug the bot which has been configured with `setDebugMode(true)`, this is done in `exampleBot.ts`.

## Publishing

A Github Action has been set up on the [main repo](https://github.com/Supalosa/supalosa-chronodivide-bot). We use npmjs's [trusted publisher](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#supported-cicd-providers) setup to do this.

To publish a new version of the bot, from the **root** directory (IMPORTANT), do this. (The `--workspaces` is important to update all of the subpackages)

```
# usually will be `patch`, can be `minor`/`major` for bigger releases
npm version patch --workspaces --include-workspace-root --no-git-tag-version
```

To set the version to a beta version, do one of the following:

```
# prepatch: 0.6.0 -> 0.6.1-beta.0
# preminor: 0.6.0 -> 0.7.0-beta.0
# premajor: 0.6.0 -> 1.0.0-beta.0
npm version prepatch --preid=beta --workspaces  --include-workspace-root --no-git-tag-version
```

If you are already on a beta version, use the following to increment the `.0`:
```
npm version prerelease --workspaces --include-workspace-root --no-git-tag-version
```

Once the version is set, do the following (unfortunately with npm workspaces we don't get this for free with `npm version`):

```npm
npm install
git add package{,-lock}.json packages/**/*.json
VERSION=$(npm pkg get version | tr -d '"')
git commit --message ${VERSION}
git tag v${VERSION}
git push origin tag v${VERSION}
```
