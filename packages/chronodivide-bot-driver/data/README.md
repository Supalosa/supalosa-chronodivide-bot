# Headless MIX files

This folder contains a zipped collection of original game files that are a subset of the original files. It is enough for the bot to run in headless mode and generate a replay.

It currently only contains data for the `temperate` tileset, and will likely not work with any map files with other tilesets.

Maps can be included in this folder too. These maps should be kept small (e.g. do not include map previews).
